# Privacy Policy for Timezone Converter for Google Sheets

This Privacy Policy describes how the Timezone Converter for Sheets add-on (the "Add-on") handles your information.

## -  Data Collection and Usage

The Add-on is designed with your privacy in mind.

- **No Personal Data is Collected**: We do not collect, store, or transmit any of your personal information. The Add-on does not have a server-side component to store data.
- **Spreadsheet Data**: The Add-on requires access to your Google Sheet to read the date/time values you want to convert. This data is processed exclusively within your browser and Google's environment to perform the conversion. It is never sent to any third-party servers or stored by us.
- **No User Tracking**: We do not use cookies or any other tracking technologies to monitor your activity.

## -  Permissions

The Add-on requires the following permissions to function:

- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets`: This allows the Add-on to read data from your active spreadsheet to perform the time conversion.
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/script.container.ui`: This allows the Add-on to display a user interface, such as the "About" dialog.

## -  Third-Party Services

The Add-on uses the open-source Moment.js and Moment-Timezone libraries, which are included in the Add-on's code. No data is sent to any external third-party service.

## -  Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
